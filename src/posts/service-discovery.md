# Service Discovery Explained

## Why

**Auto Scaling Groups** focus on instance management: They handle the provisioning, scaling, and replacement of instances to ensure that the application can handle varying workloads and remains highly available.

**Service discovery** focuses on enabling communication between services: It provides a way for services to dynamically discover each other's locations, making it easier to build and scale distributed applications.
